    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>As a highly motivated and diligent professional with a decade of experience in laboratory work, I am now eager to transition into a career in coding.  Throughout my career,
    I have honed valuable transferable skills, such as problem-solving, logical thinking, and attention to detail, that I believe will be highly beneficial in this new field.</p>
    <p>As a team player, I always look to support colleagues and integrate my skills for the benefit of the group. In a coding role, I am eager to collaborate with my team
    members and contribute to the development of innovative software solutions.  I am also persistent and adaptable, able to learn quickly.</p>
    <p>I am seeking a new challenge that will allow me to best use my skills and develop further.  I believe that a career in coding will be
    both fulfilling and rewarding, and I am excited to bring my experience and enthusiasm to a new role in this field.</p>
